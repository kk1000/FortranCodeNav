## Fortran CodeNav

### Installation

The latest stable release can be found in the Visual Studio marketplace here:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TiemenSchreuder.FortranCodeNav
### Install this update
Once you installed from the visual studio market, you can download this code build and than copy the dll etc. file to overwrite the file installed from the visual studio market.

### About

Fortran CodeNav is a Visual Studio Extension which helps you to navigate through Fortran 90 code (and other versions). It contains several parsers to generate a code structure representation which is used to provide jump-to and search functionality with limited context-awareness. Additionally it provides scope-aware code completion (Intellisense). 

It currently supports the following code elements/blocks:
- modules
- subroutines
- functions
- interfaces
- types

### Usage

Fortran CodeNav can be completely controlled using keyboard shortcuts. Commands typically only work when you have a fortran file open in Visual Studio.

The definition of 'member' is: modules, subroutines, functions, interfaces and types. 

      Commands:
      Ctrl-Q: Jump to declaration of member under (text) cursor
      Alt-Q: List usages of element under (text) cursor
      
      Ctrl-Space: Auto-complete statement, or show completion hints in list (Intellisense)
      
      Ctrl-Alt-Q: Search all code elements in solution
      Ctrl-Shift-Q: Search/list all members in current file
      Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Q: Search all files in solution
      
      Alt-Shift-Q: Synchronize solution explorer with currently open file

The search dialog uses two types of text searches. It uses a case-insenstive 'starts-with' search and a second pattern search which takes the casing of the search term into account (see section 'Pattern Search'). Any member matching either search method is shown as search result.

For ReSharper users: Fortran CodeNav does not use ReSharper, so a ReSharper installation is not required. The shortcuts however were chosen not to conflict with the ReSharper IDEA keymapping for those users who have both installed.

### Change Keyboard Shortcuts

Should you wish to change the shortcut keys used by Fortran CodeNav, you can do so in Visual Studio, under Tools->Options and then Environment->Keyboard. In the search box, type in FortranCodeNav and the applicable commands and their current shortcuts are listed.

### Pattern Search

Pattern search is a method to quickly filter the results without typing out the entire search term. In the pattern search all uppercase letters are considered to be followed by any number of other letters while all lowercase letters must be an exact match.

So the search term 'HL' would match 'hello' whereas the search term 'hl' would not. Expressed as a (case insensitive) wildcard pattern:
- hl = 'hl'
- HL = 'h\*l\*'

The pattern search is useful to quickly find members by their acronym:
- Fortran = FTRN
- boundaryconditions = BouCon
- wave_to_flow_status = WToFS

Note for ReSharper users: unlike ReSharper, Fortran CodeNav does not take the casing of the member names into account.
